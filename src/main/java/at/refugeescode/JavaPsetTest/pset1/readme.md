# Movie Database 
Let's say we want to create a movie, and have a responsibility for EUR 10 million of budget. To be able to make decisions, we should know a little bit more about movies made in the past. 
Luckily, there are some datasets easily available online. [For example, Kaggle offers large collections of datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) from which we have taken a dataset with all movie data from the past. 
## Data manipulation

## Language Constraints
You're not allowed to use any for loops in Java. All functionality can be accessed through the Stream API in Java 8. It allows you to manipulate strings and large datasets. 
Also, you're supposed to use classes and objects in the process. And before submitting, ask yourself if you're proud of your code ;-). 

## Questions to answer
* The 5 most rated films (top to bottom)
* The 5 most hired actors (top to bottom)
* The 2 most appearing movie genres (top to bottom)
* The % of male-female ratio (biggest % smallest)

## Bonus Questions to answer
Is it true that movies reflect a society?
* What are the four most popular movie genre for all Austrian movies?

Where should our movie take place?
* Which city is more popular in movie descriptions, London, Vienna, or Paris?
* Which mode of transport is mentioned more often in descriptions? Train or Airplane or Boat?
* Difficult one: How many movies explicitly refer to a city in their description?

Maybe we should adapt our movie genre to the current times? What happened after 9/11?
* What were the 5 most popular movie genres in the 7 years before 2001, and what were the most popular genres in the 7 years afterwards.
* Can you generate a bar diagram that shows the for each of the past 20 years and how often the word family shows up in the description?
* And now make this data relative to the total number of movies made that year? So as a percentage of all movies made that year mentioning the word family.
